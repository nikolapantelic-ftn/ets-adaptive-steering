# ets-adaptive-steering
This is a utility I made for myself that constantly adapts mouse steering sensitivity to truck speed in Euro Truck Simulator 2.
It exponentialy lowers the steering sensitivity as the truck speed increases to prevent accidental mouse movements from turning abruptly or crashing the truck at high speeds.
My intention is to simulate the real-life increase of steering wheel resistance at higher speeds.
